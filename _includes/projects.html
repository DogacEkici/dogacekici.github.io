                <div class="lead">
                    <p>Developed a proof of concept for a quality control machine to inspect products on a production line. The entire process was simulated to demonstrate feasibility. The machine captures images from six angles, processes them, and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to determine if the product is defective based on known visual standards. Training was conducted using simulated flawless products, and defective products were processed in simulation to identify faults. Achieved an accuracy of over 85%.</p>

                <div class="lead">
                    <p>Developed a workflow to create attack animations for a 2D game character using Stable Diffusion. The challenge was to consistently generate the same character across multiple frames. By implementing this workflow and applying minimal Photoshop edits (such as removing artifacts), I successfully produced a seamless attack animation where the character remains consistent from the first frame to the last.</p>

                <div class="lead">
                    <p>In my master's thesis, I addressed a challenge in game development related to pathfinding in non-continuous maps, which include elements like jumping and climbing. While standard A* algorithms handle continuous maps efficiently, non-continuous maps require linking isolated islands, increasing development time and limiting NPC movements. I designed an AI model capable of learning and exploring the entire game map autonomously. This model's meaningful movements were recorded and used to create a map structure that mimics the learned behavior. Consequently, the game features NPCs that imitate the AI agent's navigation without real-time AI computation.</p>
