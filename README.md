# Doğaç Ekici's Personal Site

Welcome to my personal site where I showcase my projects and interests in artificial intelligence, game development, and 3D art.

## About Me

I am a dedicated technology enthusiast with a strong interest in AI, game development, and 3D art. My passion lies in innovating and exploring the intersections of these fields to solve real-world problems and create engaging digital experiences.

Currently, I work at Paket Mutfak, where I am learning to become a Software Crafter. My projects include developing a machine learning-based quality control system, creating 2D game character animations with Stable Diffusion, and addressing pathfinding challenges in game development through AI.

In my free time, I explore 3D modeling and animation techniques and write articles for Fikir Gazetesi on the impact of AI on society and how we can shape our future with technological advancements.

## Projects

### Quality Control Machine Proof of Concept
Developed a proof of concept for a quality control machine designed to inspect products on a production line. This machine captures images from six angles, processes them, and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to determine if the product is defective based on known visual standards. Achieved an accuracy of over 85% through simulation.

### 2D Game Character Attack Animations with Stable Diffusion
Created a workflow to produce attack animations for a 2D game character using Stable Diffusion. Overcame the challenge of consistently generating the same character across multiple frames by implementing this workflow and applying minimal Photoshop edits.

### Pathfinding in Non-Continuous Maps for Game Development
In my master's thesis, I designed an AI model capable of learning and exploring non-continuous game maps, which include elements like jumping and climbing. This model's movements were recorded to create a map structure that mimics the learned behavior, allowing NPCs to navigate without real-time AI computation.

### Passionate 3D Art Enthusiast
As a 3D art enthusiast, I dedicate my free time to learning and exploring new techniques in modeling and animation. Additionally, I write articles for Fikir Gazetesi on AI and sociology, focusing on the impact of AI on our lives and how we can shape our future with technological advancements.

## Articles

I regularly contribute articles to Fikir Gazetesi on topics related to artificial intelligence and sociology. Here are some of my works:
